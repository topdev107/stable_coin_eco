Associate Android Developer Certification is a performance exam where developers write real apps to show their skill and validate themselves. I received it after passed exam and interview by Google

=====================

Hello, After reading over your job description, it looks like a perfect fit for my skills and experience.
As an experienced full-stack developer, I have +7 years of professional experience working on enterprise and startup projects.

I have spent most of my career in web development-starting with javascript, moving on to React.js and Node.js, and now I am mastering the full stack development field.
MERN stack is my main development skill and I have rich experience in React.js, Node.js and MongoDB

One of my exciting projects was for an insurance company.
It consists of mainly two main projects - one is for advertising site and the other one is analyzing the actions and behavior of users.
By using GTM I record the actions (form clicks, page views and etc) in advertising project which is built with React.js for frontend.
And on the analyzing project, I get data from google cloud storage and analyze the data so that insurance company will increase their advertising rate, and also do marketing with api(facebook api, taboola api, twitter api) etc easily on my project which uses MERN stack(Next.js).

I can provide full time work and regular system maintenance for the project.
Let's discuss project in further details, I always available for discussion.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards
